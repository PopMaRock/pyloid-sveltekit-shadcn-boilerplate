# Pyloid Sveltekit Shadcn Boilerplate

This project was created using the Pyloid boilerplate.<br/>
It is intended for my use because I can't be arsed typing/copying all this to start my next failed project.<br/><br/>
There is a 3 second delay (set in main.py) to launch as haven't bothered to put splashscreen in and need time to load vite server.
